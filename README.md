Frontend :- developed a modern landing page UI using vanilla CSS and JavaScript and added logic to dynamically render songs randomly , everytime the user refreshes the site.  
Backend :- There was no open source API available for this so i had to manually scrape the data using Axios and Cheerio Library, then converted the scraped data to JSON format and fetched it on the client side.
